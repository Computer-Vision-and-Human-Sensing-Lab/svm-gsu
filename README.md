# svm-gsu

A C++ framework for training/testing Support Vector Machine with Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (SVM-GSU).

This is the implementation code for the Linear SVM Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (LSVM-GSU), which was first proposed in [1], and the Kernel SVM Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (KSVM-iGSU), proposed in [2]. If you want to use one of the above classifiers, please consider citing the appropriate references (see at the end of this document).
